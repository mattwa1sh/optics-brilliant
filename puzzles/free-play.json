Experiment freely with mirrors, the ball, and the eye to explore reflections.<br><br>Click show rays to show the photon paths, represented by a solid line, and the paths to virtual images, represented by dashed lines.<br><br>Different order virtual images (ie, reflections) are represented by different colors. A 2nd order image-- a reflection of a reflection is rendered as purple. In real life, they are all blue. But that is both boring and confusing, and we Optics Investigators prefer not to bore or confuse.<br><br>Also! The eye matters. It needs to be positioned correctly to see the virtual images. It cant see through the opaque (black) side of mirrors.",
