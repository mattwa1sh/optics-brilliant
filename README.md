# Matt W's Optics Game For Brilliant

In this game, you'll explore how light and reflection work by interacting with puzzles involving mirrors, a blue ball, and an eye observing the scene. There's a fun sandbox where you can get a feel for how the system works and the optics behind it. Virtual images created by reflection are different colors, on a per-order basis. So a first order reflection is green, second order purple, etc. Mirrors have a reflective side (blue) and a non-reflective side (black). 

Be sure to click "Show Rays", and the click on the various virtual images to see the ray path for each!

After the "free play" session, the game progresses in three puzzle types, reflection generation, ray path identification, and a "light detective" game where you'll identify errant virtual images. 

## Puzzle Type 1: Reflection Generation

 Create a certain number and type of reflections-- first-order, second-order, third-order, or total-- using mirrors, blue ball, and an eye. This is much like the "free play" sandbox, except there are requirements on what you create. 

## Puzzle Type 2: Light Path Identification

Given a completed scene with multiple reflections, trace the correct path of light from the object (ball) to the eye via virtual images. 

This is a _little bit tricky_. The game starts off by giving you the last hit point from the mirror to the eye, with a dashed line to the last virtual image. Your job is to click the virtual images and trace your way back to the blue ball, from which, of course, the images originate. Remember! The virtual image appears across the _axis_ of the mirror that created it. 

## Puzzle Type 3: Find the Fake Virtual Image

Identify incorrect virtual images in a puzzle setup that otherwise appears valid. 

If you _double click_ the virtual image, it will receive a red X. That means bad. When you've decided which virtual images are incorrect, you click submit solution.
